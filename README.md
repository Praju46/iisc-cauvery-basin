# Cauvery River Basin Studies – IISc

This repository documents geospatial analysis, hydrological modelling,
and river basin management studies conducted for the Cauvery River Basin
as part of research work at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru.

The work supports integrated river basin management, floodplain assessment,
geomorphological characterization, and sustainable planning strategies.

## Project Overview

The Cauvery River Basin is a complex and highly managed river system,
requiring integrated analysis of climate, hydrology, geomorphology,
and land use dynamics. This project combines multi-source satellite data,
climate datasets, field observations, and automated geospatial workflows
to support basin-scale environmental assessment and decision-making.

## Key Contributions & Activities

- Collaborated with multidisciplinary research teams from **IISc** and
  **NIT Tiruchirappalli** to support integrated river basin management
  and sustainable planning initiatives.

- Processed and analyzed climate datasets including **CMIP6** and **IMD**
  using **Python** for hydrological and environmental modelling, demonstrating
  readiness for Earth System Model (ESM) integration.

- Supervised a team of **four interns** and coordinated with partner
  institutions to ensure timely execution of geomorphological and
  hydrological analysis tasks.

- Performed detailed **river channel and valley margin mapping** using
  Sentinel-2 imagery and Google Earth; generated centrelines, longitudinal
  profiles, and contours from DEMs to support geomorphological analysis.

- Mapped **physiographic zones**, classified channel sinuosity, and conducted
  **river style classification (40+ styles)** based on valley confinement,
  lithology, and channel pattern. Identified and categorized river islands
  and multiple bar types.

- Produced **multi-year flood inundation maps (2015–2024)** using
  Sentinel-1 SAR data; delineated active floodplains through frequency
  analysis and developed **automated geospatial workflows using Python**.

- Processed diverse environmental datasets including soil moisture,
  lithology, texture, and nutrients (**15+ parameters**), along with
  satellite imagery from **PlanetScope, Bhuvan, Bhukosh, and CORONA**
  for hydrological, land use, and site suitability analyses.

- Participated in **field surveys** involving water quality sampling,
  sediment collection, geomorphological observations, and bio-assessment;
  additionally contributed to agricultural mapping (cropping patterns,
  irrigation, yield estimation), UAV planning, and represented the
  Cauvery Basin at the **India Water Impact Summit (IWIS) 2024**.

- Estimated **soil erosion using the RUSLE model** and calculated
  **sediment yield (1990–2024)** to support watershed management
  and river conservation planning.
